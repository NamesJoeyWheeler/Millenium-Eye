A Python program for getting server links from Stan.

Plans:

You type in a link from Stan.

Example: https://play.stan.com.au/programs/1361288/play

Then the program will give you a link from Stan's servers, that contain download urls.

What's the point?

After this is made, I plan to making a program that can download the videos.
But for now, my plan is to make a program that gives a link.
