# Millenium-Eye
A Python program for getting server links from Stan.

# How To Use

Millenium Eye:

Run the .py file with whatever you use to run them.

Type in the episode/movie ID from Stan

Example: https://play.stan.com.au/programs/1361288/play

Type in the numbers (which is 1361288 in this instance)

It will give you a link, which contains all the video links.

Millenium Eye Sub Extractor:

Same method as Millenium Eye, except it gives a link to subtitles.

To Download the subtitles, you can open up the link in Chrome. Then you right click, save as, then you must set it as All Files and save it as a .vtt file.

I am planning on having it download the sub in the future.
