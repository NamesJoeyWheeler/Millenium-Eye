# Millenium-Eye
A Python program for getting server links from Stan.

# Things Needed
-Python 3

-Windows (Unknown if working on other operating systems)

-Stan Account (Optional, but would be good for getting the IDs)


# How To Use

Millenium Eye:

-Run the .py file with whatever you use to run them (I recommend CMD)

-Type in the episode/movie ID from Stan

Example: https://play.stan.com.au/programs/1361288/play

-THE ID is the bunch of numbers (which is 1361288 in this instance)

-It will give you a link, which contains all the video links.

Millenium Eye Sub Extractor:

-Same method as Millenium Eye, except it gives a link to subtitles.

Millenium Eye Sub Downloader:

-Run the .py file with Python (Doesn't work in CMD)

-Type in the link you got from the Sub Extractor (Make sure that the link works)

-It will then download the subtitle file in the folder.

# How To Download The Files

I have no idea how to download any of the video links, but hopefully in the future I will.

To Download the subtitles, you can use the Millenium Eye Sub Downloader or you can use chrome.

To download them in Chrome, you must enter the sub link, right click, save as, then save it as a .vtt file (make sure it doesn't save as a .txt file.
