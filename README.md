# Millenium-Eye
A Python program for getting server links from Stan.

# How To Use

Run the .py file with whatever you use to run them.

Type in the episode/movie ID from Stan

Example: https://play.stan.com.au/programs/1361288/play

Type in 1361288

It will give you a link, which contains all the video links.

# What's the point?

After this is made, I plan to making a program that can download the videos.
But for now, my plan is to make a program that gives a link.
