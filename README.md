# Millenium-Eye
A Python program for getting server links from Stan.

# How To Use

Millenium Eye:

Install Python (Duh)

Run the .py file with whatever you use to run them (I recommend CMD)

Type in the episode/movie ID from Stan

Example: https://play.stan.com.au/programs/1361288/play

THE ID is the bunch of numbers (which is 1361288 in this instance)

It will give you a link, which contains all the video links.

Millenium Eye Sub Extractor:

Same method as Millenium Eye, except it gives a link to subtitles.

# How To Download The Files

I have no idea how to download any of the video links, but hopefully in the future I will.

To Download the subtitles, you can open up the link in Chrome. Then you right click, save as, then you must set it as All Files and save it as a .vtt file.

I am planning on having it download the sub in the future.
